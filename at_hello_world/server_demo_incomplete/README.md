# @Protocol Hello World Demo (Incomplete Version)

This directory contains the incomplete code for the Hello World application. Complete the 
TODOs to get it working!

## Getting Started

Clone this project from the @ Company repository. To run the app, make sure to have your docker
containers running and have your machine pointing to the local DNS server (the address is 127.0.0.1).
You can only use this app with one test @sign at a time (e.g. @kevinðŸ› ). If you'd like to use a different
test @sign, uninstall the Flutter app from your emulator and build it again.
