### Now for a little internet optimism

# at_hello_world

# @Protocol Hello World

This directory contains the complete code for the Hello World application. Feel free to use
this for testing, debugging, or just trying out the app!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project from the @ Company repository.

2. To run the app, make sure to have your docker containers running and have your machine pointing to the local DNS server (the address is 127.0.0.1).

### For Windows:

Navigate to:

Settings > Network & Internet > Change Adapter Settings > Select adapter, Properties >  Internet version 4 (TCP/IPv4). 

Then use the following DNS server addresses:

DNS=127.0.0.1

FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1

**You will need to restart your machine**
**Then restart the DNS system using the command (in Command Prompt):**

ipconfig /flushdns


### For Mac:

Navigate to:

System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS. 

From here add 127.0.0.1 at the top by clicking on the "+" icon.



**Side Note:** You can only use this app with one test @sign at a time (e.g. @kevinðŸ› ). If you'd like to use a different
test @sign, uninstall the Flutter app from your emulator and build it again.
