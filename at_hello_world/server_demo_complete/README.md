# @Protocol Hello World Demo (Complete Version)

This directory contains the complete code for the Hello World application. Feel free to use
this for testing, debugging, or just trying out the app!

## Getting Started

Clone this project from the @ Company repository. Make sure that you've completed the prequisites
listed in the at_hello_world readme! You can only use this app with one test @sign at a time (e.g.
@kevinðŸ›  or @colinðŸ› ). To use a different test @sign, uninstall the app from your emulator and build
it again.
