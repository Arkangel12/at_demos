### Now for a little internet optimism

# @Protocol Hello World Demo (QR Code Version)

This directory contains the complete code for the Hello World application with the QR code reader. 
As you may have noticed, the "root" String in the config file has changed to "root.atsign.org"! This 
version of the hello world application does not rely on the virtual environment, so you can use real @signs 
(including your own!) to play with it. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project from The @ Company repository.
2. If you've used an @sign on your emulator previously, make sure to cold boot it before 
you run this application.  
3. Go to your @sign portal from atsign.com and download the QR code for any one of your @signs. 
Drag and drop this file into the emulatorâ€”you will need it for when you first sign in!
4. Run the app on your emulator, and make sure to check off all the permissions when asked (this is asked 
so that the QR code scanner can actually function). When prompted, double click on the button to upload your 
QR code.
5. The screen may load for a while, but you should be signed in once the process finishes! You can now seamlessly 
sign into all of your @protocol apps.
