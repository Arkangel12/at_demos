### Now for a little internet optimism

# at_demos

Welcome! We have a collection of demo @pps written to help you get a head start on your @protocol journey. We recommend looking at the @pps in the followering order:

1. `at_hello_world`: A beginner @pp that introduces the fundamental @protocol verbs
2. `at_chats`, `at_cookbook`: Intermediate-level applications that builds on the `at_hello_world` app to create a messaging service as well as a cookbook. 
3. `@mosphere`: A production-level application (included in a separate repo) that uses advanced @protocol verbs to stream large files across multiple @signs

## Creating your own @protocol application

Just like any Flutter app, an @protocol application requires a little bit of setup before you can get started. Here are those steps:

1. Add the service file to your @pp: You can simply copy this service file from the `at_hello_world` application. This file contains helper methods that allow you to implement @protocol functionality with just a couple lines of code. 
2. Add the configuration file to your @pp: Again, feel free to copy this from the `at_hello_world` application. This file contains variables that allow you to use the virtual environment. Make sure that the `ROOT_DOMAIN` string is set to `vip.ve.atsign.zone` and you have a unique name for the `NAMESPACE` of your @pp!


We are super glad that you are beginning your journey as an @dev. We highly recommend that you join our discord dev community for troubleshooting, dev updates, and much more!
